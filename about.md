## Learn more about my journey

In December 2016, I graduated with a double major: B.S. in Applied Economics and B.S. in Business from University of the Pacific, while playing D1 Beach and Indoor Volleyball as a starting player and taking on two internships my senior year.

My passion for economics and business has taken me toward econometrics and research where I learnt statistics and regressions analysis. I fell in love with the idea of using data to solve complex human/business problems.
After working for one year in the SaaS industry, I decided to deepen my analytics knowledge and further my education in the data science space.

I earned my STEM degree at University of California, Irvine. The degree combines Machine Learning and Business Operations and teaches hands on programming skills. (SQL, Python, R, Alteryx).

I inspire to be the bridge between data science and end stakeholders. One of the biggest challenges for data-oriented organizations is effecitve communication and visual interpretation of insights. My passion lies in behavioral data science , people analytics and creating spiritual business leaders.

In my free time I practice meditation and yoga, read personal development books and play beach volleyball.
Namaste.
