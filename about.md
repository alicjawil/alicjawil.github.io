## Learn more about my journey

In December 2016, I graduated with a double major: B.S. in Applied Economics and B.S. in Business from University of the Pacific, while playing D1 Beach and Indoor Volleyball as a starting player and taking on two internships my senior year.

My passion for economics and business has taken me toward econometrics and research where I learnt statistics and regressions analysis. I fell in love with the idea of using data to solve complex human/business problems.
After working for one year in the SaaS industry in business development roles, I decided to deepen my analytics knowledge and further my education in the data science space.

I earned M.S. degree at University of California, Irvine with emphasis on learning Machine Learnign that impacts business today. I got experience in hands on programming experience(SQL, Python, R, Alteryx).

I inspire to be the bridge between technical data science concepts and end stakeholders. One of the biggest challenges for data-oriented organizations is having technical members on the team that can explain work and results in an intuitive way to clients, keeping business context important. My passion lies in behavioral data science and people analytics. 

In my free time I practice meditation and yoga, read personal development books and play beach volleyball.
Namaste.
