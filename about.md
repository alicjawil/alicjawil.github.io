## Learn more about my journey

I hold a B.S. in Economics and another B.S. in Business. My passion for economics and business has taken me toward econometric and research where I mastered statistics and regressions analysis. I fell in love with the idea of using data to solve complex human/business problems. 

After working for one year in the SaaS industry in business development roles, I decided to deepen my analytics knowledge and further my education in the data science space.

I earned M.S. degree at University of California, Irvine with emphasis on Data Science and Machine Learning with hands on programming expereince(SQL, Python, R, Alteryx) 

Open to full-time data scientist/data analyst/product analyst positions. 

Namaste.
