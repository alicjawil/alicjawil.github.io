## Learn more about my journey

In December 2016, I graduated with a double major: B.S. in Applied Economics and B.S. in Business from University of the Pacific, while playing D1 Beach and Indoor Volleyball as a starting player and taking on two internships my senior year.

My passion for economics and business has taken me toward econometrics and research where I mastered statistics and regressions analysis. I fell in love with the idea of using data to solve complex human/business problems. 

After working for one year in the SaaS industry in business development roles, I decided to deepen my analytics knowledge and further my education in the data science space.

I earned M.S. degree at University of California, Irvine with emphasis on Data Science and Machine Learning with hands on programming expereince(SQL, Python, R, Alteryx) 

I inspire to be that bridge/connection between technical data science concepts and end stakeholders. One of the biggest challenge for data-oriented organizations is not having a technical members on the team that can explain work and results in an intuitive way to clients, keeping business context important. This often creates miscommunications that can lead to frustration between departments. My cross-functional business and data science experience allows me to close that gap. 

In my free time I practice meditation and yoga, read personal development books and play beach volleyball. 

Namaste.
