title: Exploring XGBoost

## **XGBoost simple example.**

XGBoost an extreme boosting algorithm that works under [Gradient Boosting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). 

XGBoost is powerful, flexible and efficient. It provides a parallel tree boosting algorithm. XGBoost is a supervised algorithm where we predict y given labeled input data x.

Gradient boosting is founded on gradient descent ideology to be able to best optimize the cost function. 

Take a look at my example in Python [here](https://alicjawil.github.io/projects/XGboost-ex.html)
