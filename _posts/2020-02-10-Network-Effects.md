title: Network Effects and A/B Testing 
---

## **Network A/B Testing.**

When sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Google do A/B Testing on UI and UX they might run into some problems if user from Group Testing A is friends with a user  from Group Testing B or if the news of a new tested piece spread online. That is the Network Effects challenge that those giants are faced with. 

When you test a new feature to 25% of your users and that feature is visibly noticeable or easy to spot - like new filters or new way of posting comments. If the 25% of the users start taking about the new feature online or to friends that do not have that feature,  the rest of the users start to wonder what is going on. Customer loyalty might be compromised and unwanted attention is being brought up to the A/B Testing. 

How to deal with Network Effects while running experiments?
I will share a research paper summary that directly addressed this problem soon, and in the meantime read the whole piece yourself [here.](https://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/www15_hgui.pdf)
