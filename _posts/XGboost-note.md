XGBoost an extreme boosting algorithm that works under [Gradient Boosting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). 

XGBoost is powerful, flexible and efficient. It provides a parallel tree boosting algorithm. XGBoost is a supervised algorithm where we predict y given labeled input data x.

Gradient boosting is founded on gradient descent ideology to be able to best optimize the cost function. 

Below is an example of XGBoost on Boston dataset.
